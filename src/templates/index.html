    <h1>Senate Surveys</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        The Rensselaer Union Student Senate's Web Technologies Group has created a surveying platform that 
        allows the student body at RPI to create their own custom-made survey (in development). 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" href="form">Start Survey</a>
        <a class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" href="home">Create your own survey</a>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
     <div class="col-lg-4">
        <h2>Completely anonymous</h2>
        <p>While this survey requires that students log in using a valid RCS user ID,
        the survey itself is completely anonymous. The login is merely used to
        authenticate that survey participants are affiliated with RPI, and all
        personally-identifiable user information is deleted after the session is
        complete. An irreversible hash of your RCS ID is recorded to ensure that the
        survey is taken only once, and this hash is not linked to your survey response.
        Furthermore, the open-source code for the survey platform can be found <a
        href="https://github.com/wtg/senate-survey">on GitHub</a>.</p>
