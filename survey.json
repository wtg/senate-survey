Ideally, this value would be calculated by summing the amount over the last year and dividing by 12, but we understand there will be some necessary approximations in this calculation. Other questions will ask for a total value over the last 12 months. Please be sure to answer each type of question appropriately with a numeric value rounded to the nearest whole-dollar amount. Furthermore, be sure that you are only counting expenses once. For example, you may feel that one type of expense could be included under either section 7. Technology and Entertainment or 8. Personal Care (e.g. a hobby-related expense like a digital camera). In these scenarios, only include this cost once. It does not matter which category you list the cost under, only that it is not included more than once.",
