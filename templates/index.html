        The Rensselaer Union Student Senate has created this brief survey to
        collect campus sentiment on a wide array of topics that affect
        students' lives on a regular basis. This survey's anonymous results
        will be used by the Senate and various committees in their efforts to
        improve RPI and accurately represent the interests of the greater student body.

        <h2>Completely anonymous</h2>
        <p>While this survey requires that students log in using a valid RCS user ID,
        the survey itself is completely anonymous. The login is merely used to
        authenticate that survey participants are affiliated with RPI, and all
        personally-identifiable user information is deleted after the session is
        complete. An irreversible hash of your RCS ID is recorded to ensure that the
        survey is taken only once, and this hash is not linked to your survey response.
        Furthermore, the open-source code for the survey platform can be found <a
        href="https://github.com/wtg/senate-survey">on GitHub</a>.</p>
