    <p class="lead">The purpose of this survey is to collect widespread information about the living costs of Rensselaer graduate students. This survey platform is run by the Web Technologies Group, which is a Student Senate committee.

        <h2>Completely Anonymous</h2>
        <p>
            While this survey requires that students sign in using a valid RCS ID, the survey itself is completely anonymous. The authentication is merely used to ensure that survey participants are affiliated with Rensselaer, and all personally identifiable user information is deleted after the session is complete. An irreversible hash of your RCS ID is recorded to ensure that the survey can be taken only once, and this hash is not linked to your survey response. Furthermore, the open-source code for this survey platform can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wtg/senate-survey">GitHub</a>.
