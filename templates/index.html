    <h1>Impact of COVID-19 on TA's and Students</h1>
    <h2>Fall 2021</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        COVID-19 has had profound effects on learning at RPI. As we work in a hybrid setting, the Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) of the 52nd Student Senate would like to gauge TA and student satisfaction with this altered learning environment. The responses to this survey will be reviewed by the AAC and potential suggestions will be posted as they see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may only complete this application <b>once</b>, so make sure you are responding accurately.
        The survey will close on <b>Wednesday, November 24th</b>.

        <h2>Completely anonymous</h2>
        <p>While this survey requires that students log in using a valid RCS user ID,
        the survey itself is completely anonymous. The login is merely used to
        authenticate that survey participants are affiliated with RPI, and all
        personally-identifiable user information is deleted after the session is
        complete. An irreversible hash of your RCS ID is recorded to ensure that the
        survey is taken only once, and this hash is not linked to your survey response.
        Furthermore, the open-source code for the survey platform can be found <a
        href="https://github.com/wtg/senate-survey">on GitHub</a>.</p>
